//! Redraw transactions for the native UI.
//!
//! `WM_SETREDRAW(FALSE)` is implemented by DefWindowProc by clearing `WS_VISIBLE`. On a top-level
//! window that removes the window from hit testing, so a click lands on whatever window is behind
//! RZhuangJi, and DWM may stop presenting it for a frame, which shows up as a full-window flash.
//! Redraw is therefore only suspended on child windows; a top-level transaction repaints once.
//! Repaints never request `RDW_ERASE`: every RZhuangJi surface paints its own background, and an
//! erase pass with a class brush is exactly the intermediate frame that is seen as flicker.
